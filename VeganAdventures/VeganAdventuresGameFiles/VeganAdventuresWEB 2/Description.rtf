\f0\fs26 \cf0 Vegan Adventures was a solo project and everything was created from the ground up using Maya and Unity.\'a0 The physics engine from Unity was used, but some of the original physics work of mine was the falling environment effects (the trees that fall down and the platform that can be knocked upsidedown and over).\'a0 Everything was written in Javascript. \'a0Please forgive me on the art, I am no artist unfortunately. \'a0Went with an 8bit look actually and it worked out quite well.}
